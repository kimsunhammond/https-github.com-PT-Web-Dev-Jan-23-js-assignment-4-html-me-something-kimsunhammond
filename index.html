               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">What are you doing this weekend? I'm excited to be playing in a mixed-doubles tennis tournament Saturday night and then I have another match on Sunday morning. Of course I will be spending plenty of time with my three sweet furbabies, which surely will include lots snuggling on the couch while I recover from all of my hard work. Maybe I'll even <a href="https://food52.com/recipes/36473-salted-chocolate-chip-cookies">bake something delicious to eat</a> while I'm lounging. Hope you have a good one, and here are a few links from around the web...</p>

               <h3 id="title">Tennis things</h3>
               <p class="things">These <a href="https://www.tennis-warehouse.com/NikeCourt_Zoom_NXT_Womens_Tennis_Shoes/catpage-WSZOOMNXT.html">low-profile tennis shoes</a> have helped prevent me from rolling an ankle while I play and it doesn't hurt that they're also cute. I have them in two colors and plan on getting another pair (or two) when they're on sale.</p>

               <p class="things">Going makeup-free is preferable during any sweaty activity, but <a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/beauty/sweat-proof-makeup">sometimes you just want to be extra.</a></p>
            
               <p class="things">I used to never wear dresses while playing tennis- they just seemed too precious. My kit has always been a pair of shorts or skirt and a top. Chalk it up to evolving taste (or maybe just laziness, since realizing that wearing a dress means that I don't have to rummage through the laundry for a <em>matching</em> shirt and skirt), I've had my eye on <a href="https://athleta.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=534796022&mlink=AllNav_AllDresses_0214_AdvantageDress&vid=1#pdp-page-content">this dress.</a></p>

               <p class="things">Warmer weather means it's time for a wardrobe freshen-up. While I've been living in <a href="https://www.blundstone.com/black-premium-leather-v-cut-boots-womens-style-510">these boots</a> over fall and winter, I'm looking forward to switching to some <a href="https://www.jcrew.com/p/womens/categories/shoes/new-balance/new-balancereg-996-womenaposs-sneakers/M0476?display=all&fit=Classic&color_name=grey/silver&colorProductCode=M0476">lighter trainers</a> that would look great with <a href="https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-easy-workwear-dress-kalamata?collection=womens-dresses">this shirt dress</a> or <a href="https://bananarepublic.gap.com/browse/product.do?pid=594721002&vid=1&&searchText=jumpsuit#pdp-page-content">this version.</a></p>
               <p class="things">Given my love of all things pink, this just might be the <a href="https://us.rivedroite-paris.com/products/custine-xl-the-waist-bag-recycled-cotton-bois-de-rose">perfect new everyday spring bag.</a> For a bit of an upgrade, <a href="https://www.madewell.com/hyer-goods-camera-bag-N7301.html?dwvar_N7301_color=EC5628&cgid=accessories-bags-crossbody#start=66">this</a> is a nice option.</p>

               <h3 id="title">Snack things</h3>
               <p class="things">Love cookie dough, but not quite sure about how I feel about <a href="https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/videos/want-to-eat-an-entire-bowl-of-cookie-dough/">this.</a> Would you try it?</p>
               <p class="things">Since diving into the world of Korean snacks, I've discovered a few favorites. These taste like <a href="https://www.yamibuy.com/en/p/orion-kkobug-chips-corn-soup-flavor-160g/1017019511?scene=item_search.result&bu_type=search&module_name=context_input&index=3&content=turtle%20chips&track=search-input-3-1017019511&pg=1">Bugles and Kettle Corn had a baby snack</a> that somehow turned out to be crispy and fluffy at the same time. <a href="https://www.yamibuy.com/en/p/turtle-chip-choco-churos-flavor-160g/1017042561?scene=item_search.result&bu_type=search&module_name=context_input&index=1&content=turtle%20chips&track=search-input-1-1017042561&pg=1">Same addictive texture, but chocolatey and churro-ey.</a> If you're looking for something with a little more substance, my <a href="https://www.target.com/p/nongshim-spicy-shin-noodle-soup-4-23oz/-/A-47089435">favorite ramen, which can now be found at Target(!!),</a> is sufficiently filling, especially when topped with a slice of American cheese and a soft-boiled egg.</p>

               <p class="things">Speaking of Korean snacks, I can't wait for <a href="https://www.saucemagazine.com/a/60100/korean-cafe-ganadara-is-opening-in-st-louis-hills-in-march">this place</a> to open up in my neighborhood.</p>

            <h3 id="title">Cat things</h3>
            <p class="things">You know I couldn't get away without mentioning at least one of my <a href="https://ragdolllove.com/ragdoll-cat-facts/">Ragdoll cats.</a> Our youngest, Bowie, loves to eat. (Hmm, sounds familiar.) With <a href="https://www.chewy.com/b/food-387">Chewy autoship,</a> I know that we will always have his prescription food on hand before it runs out. That's one less stress for me, and it has really been a game-changer to be able to order it online and schedule delivery. I may or may not be telling the truth by saying that Bowie gets excited when he sees the Chewy box sitting at the front door.</p>

            <p class="things">And for all of you doubters, I think this proves that <a href="https://www.oprahdaily.com/life/a32884389/signs-your-cat-loves-you/"> my cats love me very much.</a></p>
